        <h2>Collins Aerospace</h2>
        <p>I've been working fulltime at Collins Aerospace since January of 2024. 
            I hope you'll understand that I can't share everything I have done during my time at Collins here on the internet. 
            I'd be happy to share more if you send an <a href="contact.html">email</a> my way!</p>
        <br>
        <p>In the meantime here's a bit about my current role at Collins:
        </p>
      </header>

      <main>

        <h3>Team Structure</h3>
        <p>I work with a team of incredibly talented software developers, aerospace 
            and systems engineers, human factors experts, and pilots.
        </p> <br>
        <p>As the design professional it's my role in this team to take rough concepts 
            envisioned by the pilots and engineers and turn them into designs for our 
            concept flightdeck. I work closely with the software developers to ensure the 
            vision is built into our flight deck using our suite of custom tools.
        </p> <br>
        <p>Once the designs are implemented, I'll work with the human factors experts to 
            design and execute user research studies to validate and inform future 
            iterations of our interfaces.
        </p>

        <h3>Design Tools</h3>
        <p>I use Figma heavily on my Team at Collins. The collaborative-ness of Figma is 
            essential to share ideas quickly across all of our different fields
        </p> <br>
        <p>We've also built our own software/plugin to turn the Figma prototypes designed 
            by me into interfaces that can be used on our concept flight deck and talk to 
            our flight sim software.
        </p> <br>
        <p>If Figma isn't enough to get the story across, I turn to illustrator or just 
            plain old power point to share ideas to audiences that might have trouble 
            grasping what Figma is (Figma isn't used that much in the aerospace engineering 
            world...).
        </p> <br>
        <p>Finally I'm a big proponent of prototyping on whiteboards or a sheet of paper 
            and a Sharpie. I think all of the whiteboards at Collins fill up with a 
            combination of UI concepts, aviation regulations, and math equations whenever 
            our team is on site together.
        </p>
