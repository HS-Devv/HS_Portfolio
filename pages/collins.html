        <!-- project summary -->
        <h4>Project summary</h4><br>
        <p>Since January 2024, I‚Äôve been working full-time at Collins Aerospace as a UX/UI designer for concept flight decks. Due to the confidential nature of the work, 
          I‚Äôm limited in what I can share publicly, but I‚Äôd be happy to chat and share more details if you <a href="contact.html">reach out!</a>
        </p><br>
        <p>This role has given me the opportunity to collaborate with aerospace engineers, pilots, human factors experts, and software developers to 
          bring early concepts to life and help shape the future of flight deck design.</p>
        
        <img src="../assets/collinsPhotos/plane.png" data-dark="../assets/collinsPhotos/planeLight.png" class="collins-img"/>


        <!-- my role -->
        <h4>My role</h4><br>
        <p>On my team, I am the design professional, responsible for taking early ideas, often just rough sketches or conversations 
          from pilots and engineers, and turning them into interactive designs for our concept flight deck.
        </p><br>
        <p>I work closely with software developers to make sure our designs are implemented smoothly using our custom-built tools. Once designs are in place, 
          I partner with human factors experts to design and run user research studies to validate our work and guide future iterations.
        </p><br>

        <!-- the challenge -->
        <h4>The challenge</h4><br>
        <p>Flight deck design is incredibly complex. Our users are pilots who need tools that are intuitive, reliable, and able to support quick 
          decision-making in high-stakes environments.
        </p><br>
        <p>Beyond usability, there are strict aerospace regulations and technical constraints we must work within, 
          along with the need to present highly technical information in ways that are instantly understandable.
        </p><br>
        <p>Another challenge is communication: translating design ideas into a language that pilots, engineers, and executives 
          from very different backgrounds can all easily grasp.
        </p><br>
        
        <!-- solution -->
        <h4>Solution</h4><br>
          <p>I use <b>Figma</b> to build and share designs quickly between teams. The collaborative nature of Figma is essential 
            when working with colleagues across software development, human factors, and systems engineering. We also use custom software 
            that transforms the Figma prototypes I design into working interfaces for our flight simulator, allowing us to test designs in a real-time environment.
          </p><br>
          <p>When Figma isn‚Äôt enough to tell the full story, I pivot to tools like Illustrator, PowerPoint, or even just whiteboard sketches and Sharpie mockups. 
            Quick, low-fidelity prototyping is especially useful for cross-functional brainstorming sessions, 
            where our whiteboards quickly fill up with a mix of UI concepts, regulatory notes, and software architecture diagrams.
          </p><br>

          <img src="../assets/collinsPhotos/whiteboard.png" data-dark="../assets/collinsPhotos/whiteboardLight.png" class="collins-img"/>

          <p>Throughout the process, I support user research efforts‚Äîhelping design studies that validate the usability and effectiveness of our interfaces.

          </p><br>

        <!-- results -->
        <h4>Results</h4><br>
        <p>Our team has presented our concept flight deck designs to major aerospace players like Boeing, Airbus, and Embraer, as well as to C-suite executives both internally 
          at Collins Aerospace and at our parent company, RTX. Every quarter, we also present to an internal audience of over 700+ employees, helping keep our development 
          cycle iterative and maintaining excitement across the company.
        </p><br>
        <p><em>Here are some highlights from my work so far:</em></p>
        <p>‚Ä¢ Conducted user research using <b>interviews, observational studies, </b>and <b>co-design sessions</b> to better understand pilot workload and improve flight deck usability.</p> 
        <p>‚Ä¢ Developed and maintained a growing <b>design system</b> for use across multiple projects.</p>
        <p>‚Ä¢ Contributed to <b>3 patent submissions</b> and <b>6 intellectual property filings</b> based on new technologies and interaction concepts developed by our team.</p>
        <p>‚Ä¢ <b>Reduced pilot workload by 50%</b> through intuitive UI design and emerging automation technologies.</p>
